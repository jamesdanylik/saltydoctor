GENERAL
-------
Need to establish session with Salty Bet... probably want to use a fresh account in case I get busted hehe...

#balance has your balance once your logged in... zdata has everyone's balances and bets for the this round???  Also encapsulates state.json.

THE PLAN
--------
--- init ---
Simulate a login in a seperate browser window

Once logged in, read the first round of data.

--- main loop ---
Check database for info on bettors, or place blind bet/abstain in unknown.

Wait for outcome.

Log all data and place in matrix?  Maybe also log information on the other big bettors to improve perforamnce?

Wait for next round to be announced.

Read in next round of data in repeatable fashion.
--- end main loop ---
